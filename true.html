        <h3>WHAT TO CONSIDER FOR WIRELESS</h3>
        <p>Generally speaking, wireless earbuds should be sleek, comfy, water-resistant, and capable of delivering entertaining sound, regardless of what you’ll be using them for. When you’re shopping for a new pair of earbuds, you should look for a pair within your budget that has a durable design, reliable fit, dependable battery life, and solid audio performance (including during calls).Battery life in true wireless earbuds has improved a great deal over the years, which means even a budget-friendly pair will keep you entertained for at least 6 hours (or more) in between charges. When it comes to charging, a USB-C connector is now the standard for all buds out there, regardless of their price point. On the other hand, when shopping for high-end products, you can also expect a case that's compatible with wireless charging.</p>
        <h3>SOUND QUALITY</h3>
        <p>If we're being completely honest with you, most earbuds' sound quality and noise cancellation are typically directly related to their price tag — which means that spending more on a top-shelf product will inevitably get you better sound. That said, our budget-friendly picks will also keep you focused and entertained, so long as you manage your expectations.A good pair of wireless earbuds should have an official rating for water resistance, with an IPX4 rating being the minimum to make a product worth considering. The higher the rating, the more durable the headset will be. If you like working out outside, you should consider earphones that can survive exposure to water and dust.</p>
