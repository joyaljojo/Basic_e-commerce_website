# Basic_e-commerce_website
This project is a start to my journey into my coding journey, representing one of my first days into web development. 
Built entirely with HTML and CSS, this e-commerce website showcases the fundamentals of front-end web design.
Explore the simplicity and charm of early web development as you browse through the products and experience a taste of where it all began.
Dive into the code to see the building blocks of a basic e-commerce site, and witness the evolution of my coding skills over time.
